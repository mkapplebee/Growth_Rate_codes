This is a repository of my most up-to-date versions of R code used to analyze growth rate data collected from 96-well plates.  
It is built using code in the "grofit" R package (https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/grofit/index.html)

I have also included several Markdown reports of data (code), and the html markdown output files, though the html output files are not properly displaying in GitHub  
(but do properly display, with plots intact, from files when accessed locally)
