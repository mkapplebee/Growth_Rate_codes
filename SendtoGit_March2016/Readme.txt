This is a repository of my most up-to-date versions of R code used to analyze growth rate data collected from 96-well plates.  
It is built using code in the "grofit" R package (https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/grofit/index.html)

"1_gc_analysis_scripts" - contains all scripts utilized by gc_analysis-template.Rmd

"2_epi_analysis_scripts" - containst all scripts utilized by epi_analysis-template.Rmd

CssS_XXX folders contain the .Rmd and .html files that perform the "gc" and "epi" analysis on the described dataset (CssS strain set in the described growth condition)  
  - currently, the files are not executible because they still contain references to call data from the desktop addresses, and need to be updated
  - If downloaded, the html files correctly display the report and generated graphs
